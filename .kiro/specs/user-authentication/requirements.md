# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the user authentication system for the TwitterX-API backend service. The system provides comprehensive user registration, authentication, and profile management capabilities that replicate core X (formerly Twitter) authentication features. The authentication system supports multiple providers (email/password and Google OAuth), implements secure session management with Redis, and includes Twitter-specific features like unique username handling and account verification.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to create an account using email/password or Google OAuth, so that I can access the platform and start using Twitter-like features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides valid email and password THEN the system SHALL create a new account with unique username
2. WHEN a user chooses Google OAuth THEN the system SHALL authenticate via Google and create account with provider data
3. WHEN a user provides an already registered email THEN the system SHALL return error suggesting sign in instead
4. WHEN email is provided THEN the system SHALL store both original casing and lowercase version for uniqueness
5. WHEN a user provides invalid username format THEN the system SHALL return error with format requirements
6. IF email is provided THEN the system SHALL send verification email before account activation
7. WHEN username is already taken THEN the system SHALL return error with alternative suggestions
8. WHEN birth date is provided during registration THEN the system SHALL store it as immutable data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to sign in to my account using my credentials, so that I can access my personalized Twitter experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user provides valid email/password THEN the system SHALL authenticate case-insensitively and create session
2. WHEN user provides valid Google OAuth THEN the system SHALL authenticate via provider and support multiple OAuth providers per user
3. WHEN user provides invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL increment failed attempt counter
4. IF user exceeds maximum login attempts THEN the system SHALL lock account temporarily
5. WHEN successful authentication occurs THEN the system SHALL create Redis session with configurable timeout
6. WHEN user signs in from new device THEN the system SHALL send login alert notification

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my profile information and account settings, so that I can customize my Twitter presence and maintain account security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user updates profile information THEN the system SHALL validate and save changes (excluding immutable fields like birthDate)
2. WHEN user changes username THEN the system SHALL validate and update username with case-insensitive uniqueness check
3. WHEN user requests password reset THEN the system SHALL send secure reset link via email
4. WHEN user updates email THEN the system SHALL require verification of new email address
5. IF user deactivates account THEN the system SHALL perform soft delete preserving data
6. WHEN user views profile THEN the system SHALL display all current profile information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure session management across multiple devices, so that I can stay logged in conveniently while maintaining security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user signs in THEN the system SHALL create Redis session with device-specific timeout
2. WHEN web session is created THEN the system SHALL set 30-day expiration
3. WHEN mobile session is created THEN the system SHALL set 90-day expiration
4. WHEN user signs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate current session
5. WHEN user signs out from all devices THEN the system SHALL invalidate all user sessions
6. WHEN user views active sessions THEN the system SHALL display all current sessions with device info
7. WHEN user revokes specific session THEN the system SHALL invalidate that session only

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want unique username management with Twitter-like handles, so that I can have a distinctive identity on the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user provides username during registration THEN the system SHALL check availability case-insensitively
2. WHEN username contains invalid characters THEN the system SHALL reject with format requirements
3. IF username length is outside 3-15 characters THEN the system SHALL reject with length requirements
4. WHEN username is from blocked list THEN the system SHALL reject as inappropriate
5. WHEN user changes username THEN the system SHALL update username immediately after validation
6. WHEN username is provided THEN the system SHALL store both original casing and lowercase version for uniqueness

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want account security and moderation features, so that I can maintain platform safety and prevent abuse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN suspicious login activity is detected THEN the system SHALL trigger additional verification
2. WHEN account receives multiple abuse reports THEN the system SHALL enable suspension capability
3. WHEN account is suspended THEN the system SHALL prevent authentication and show suspension reason
4. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL temporarily block further attempts
5. IF account shows bot-like behavior THEN the system SHALL enable shadow ban functionality
6. WHEN verification is granted THEN the system SHALL set verified status for blue checkmark

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want my account data to be stored securely with proper privacy controls, so that my personal information is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user data is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive information
2. WHEN passwords are stored THEN the system SHALL use secure hashing algorithms
3. WHEN sessions are created THEN the system SHALL use secure cookie settings (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
4. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL implement CSRF protection
5. IF account is set to private THEN the system SHALL restrict data visibility accordingly
6. WHEN user requests data deletion THEN the system SHALL comply with privacy requirements

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the API, I want consistent and well-documented authentication endpoints, so that I can build reliable client applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL use /v1/ prefix for versioning
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return consistent error format with helpful messages
3. WHEN rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and retry headers
4. WHEN OAuth flow is initiated THEN the system SHALL handle provider redirects securely
5. IF API documentation is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive Swagger/OpenAPI specs
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log appropriately for debugging while protecting user privacy
